            Who Are We? Why are we here?
        </p>
        <p style="color:black;font-size:25px">
            We're a small independent not-for-profit dedicated to combating the problem of the rising desparity<br>
            between housing. One of the biggest contributing factors to this is the damage caused by natural <br />
            disasters. It has been shown especially over the past two decades that after major weather events, <br />
            the housing inequality gap widens. People who are affected by these storms can no longer afford <br />
            what most of us take for granted. A lot of the times these people are left without a place to eat, <br />
            a place to work, a place to call home. <br />
            <br />
            Through our site, we have been able to connect people with the help and resources they need to get back <br />
            on their feet. By finding people work and temporary places to stay while they save money, they are <br />
            able to get back on the market for a home, instead of being stuck in the cycle of overpriced apartments. <br />
            Based on past trends, it is clearly evident that people cannot afford homes after a catastrophic event, <br />
            and that trend is only going to continue in the future. With the increasingly intense weather due to <br />
            global warming, the desparity between housing is only going to worsen. Our goal is to slow this as<br />
            much as possible, and, ideally, reverse the process. <br />
